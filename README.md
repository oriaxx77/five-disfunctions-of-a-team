Disfunctional Team
* High team turnover
* Poor performance and results

High Performance Team

## Ego (Inattention to the collective result)

The goal is to create the best possible team:
* As opposed to sepherd individual careers
* Focusing on the collective results will make the team members will be better individually

### Goals 

* Define clear, near-term goals
  * Near term goals can measure the progress
  * Easy to understand
  * Specific enough to actionable
* Everyone should adopt to a set of common goals
* Constantly measure/assess the progress and adapt your plan to reach the goals (Agile Manifesto)

### Collective result 

* It doesn't matter if one department doing OK if the product/company is failing.
* E.g.:
  * The product is ready with features and stable and there are no users
  * The sales says the product is not ready
  * The product/tech says the sales are not selling the product
  * Overall the product is feiling :(
* Everyone is responsible for everything. -> collective result
* Everyone should be involved to every activity.
*  E.g.: the tech should know about the sales. The sales should know about the tech etc....

### Politics
* When people choose their words and actions based on how they want others to react rather than based on what they think
* Avoid it all the time!!!
